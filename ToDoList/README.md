# “To-Do List” App

This is the “To-Do List” application for my book, [Learn Functional Programming Without Fear](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/learn-functional-programming-book).

NOTE: I updated this source code for my [Free “Introduction to Functional Programming” video training course](https://alvinalexander.com/video-course/intro-fp/introduction/).
